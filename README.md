## Introduction:
1. Chess is a two-player strategy board game played on a chessboard, a checkered gameboard with 64 squares arranged in an 8×8 grid.
2. Each player begins with 16 pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns.
3. Each of the six piece types moves differently, with the most powerful being the queen and the least powerful the pawn.

## Movement:
### King 
* the king moves one square in any direction.
### Rook
* The rook can move any number of squares along a rank or file, but cannot leap over other pieces.
### Bishop
* The bishop can move any number of squares diagonally, but cannot leap over other pieces.
### Queen
* The queen can move any number of squares along a rank, file, or diagonal, but cannot leap over other pieces.
### Knight
* The knight moves to any of the closest squares that are not on the same rank, file, or diagonal, thus the move forms an "L"-shape: two squares vertically and one square horizontally, or two squares horizontally and one square vertically. The knight is the only piece that can leap over other pieces.
### Pawn
* The pawn can move forward to the unoccupied square immediately in front of it on the same file, or on its first move it can advance two squares along the same file, provided both squares are unoccupied (black dots in the diagram); or the pawn can capture an opponent's piece on a square diagonally in front of it on an adjacent file, by moving to that square. 
* A pawn has two special moves: the en passant capture and promotion.

## Method:
### Castling
* Neither the king nor the rook have previously moved during the game.
* There cannot be any pieces between the king and the rook.
* The king cannot be in check, nor can the king pass through squares that are under attack by enemy pieces, or move to a square where it would result in a check. Note that castling is permissible if the rook is attacked, or if the rook crosses a square that is attacked.
